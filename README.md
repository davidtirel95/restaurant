## DAY 1 & 2

### **Research and Visuals**

Looking for what's needed when tasked to build a restaurant website.
Watch and read a lot of tutorials and interviews of developpers focusing on restaurant websites. 

### **ASK RELEVANT QUESTIONS**

>Who's the targetted public ? 
What's the most important thing to see when opening the website? 
Are the featured pages and content relevant ? 
Where to next ? What's the future of your company ? Adding/deleting stuff ? An App?

>Creating the first version, tried to stick to the coffee pot colors, tried different colors, found the one I liked the most.
Tried a bunch of fonts, unsatisfied with the output, don't waste time, i'll figure it out in the next steps.
Found content such as images.
Wrote content. Decided to go on the project i had few years ago with friends and family we built in France a coffee shop/food corner under the name of Citrus Coffee.

## DAY 3 & 4 

### **DEVELOPPMENT & SOLVING PROBLEMS**

>Wrote every HTML pages except pagination cause forgotten, added later tho. 
Including bootstrap to the HTML as learning it. Even though the website hasn't the best responsive, i built it mobile first.
Add some issues with containers and columns. 
Issues to push it on Git and run it as a website, had to rename a page ton index.html, change every img and pages filepaths. 


### **THOUGHTS ON THE OUTPUT**

What could be re worked ? 

>Although I'm quite pleased with the output and how the content is displayed. Responsive part needs to be done better, as it's not working well on all devices.
Concept could fit better in the pagination, to go with the images while reading the content. 
Contact page was supposed to be a pop up window when clicked on a drop up menu placed as a button on every pages.
Image sizes needs so be re done.
Content font color has to change as i focused on other features.

What's *NEXT* ?

Going to upgrade this website during the whole BECODE training, to practice and add new features and ideas.

Thanks for reading !
